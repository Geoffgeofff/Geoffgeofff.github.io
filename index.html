<big><big><b>Croham Heights, South Croydon, Surrey; Two housing estate brochures from 1920s</b></big></big><small>

<p>Scanned form loose pages of Eric & Joyce Soper, who moved to a semi-detached at 97 Croham Valley Road, after their marriage in 1950s and lived there until they were about 97 (so perhaps brochure health claims, including "complete recovery from serious illness" true?).

<p>Regret some pages of pamplet 2 are missing. I don't see these pamphlets yet on www (in 2025)), so worth publishing here, despite being incomplete. If anyone can send the missing pages, <script language="javascript">

<figcaption>page 29; Initial estate plan; much modified during estate construction
<br> - Extra roads were added, to increase housing density; (A) Ruffets Close, (B) Ballards Rise & (C) Brent Road. 
<br> - Littleheath Woods were not built over as planned (I) (but the stub of the access road into Foxearth Rd still exists as a footpath into the woods (H)
<br> - A path joined Littleheath Woods to Croham Hurst golf course but was built over, the short stub (E) parallel to Croham Valley Rd remains (Interesting that this current track though Littleheath Woods (M) predates everything around it)
<br> - The path into Littleheath Woods from Croham Valley Rd, used to extend to Ballards dairy farm but was lost after Crest Rd built (F); 
<br> - The lost 18 hole miniature golf course is now 'Queenhill Rd Playspace' (G) (p.15 shows it in use); Acquired by Croydon 1936 <a href="https://cnhss.co.uk/green-place/queenhill-road-playspace/">see</a>; the 3 court tennis club and clubhouse in front
<br> - Croham Valley Road temporarily planned to stop at Crest Rd (D); Croham Valley Rd was designed wider than Farley Rd (J) so seemed intended to be the main road before access across to Monk's Hill was blocked; <i>[think I was told, Farley Rd was widened later, losing its trees & verges?]</i>; 
<br> - The original tracks to the dairy farm remained after Croham Valley Rd was built (K)
<br> - Seems the steep path by The Village Club was intended to be drive leading to 2 house plots? (P)
<br> - Selsdon Farm's plot is Aldi (L); 
<br> - Perhaps the estate's entry arch in the opening film above was junction of Queenhill & Byron Roads? (N); </figcaption>

<figcaption><b>May 1929</b>; 
Part of an higher resolution air photo from <a href="historicengland.org.uk">historicengland.org.uk</a>; Shows Croham Heights half-built;
<br>A; Ballards Way (at top) has been built, 
<br>B; But Croham Valley Road after Farley Rd is a chalk area (a raized chalk bund as area can flood?) & is yet to join to Crest Road chalk roundations; Cow herd still grazing there, as part of Ballards Way dairy farm.
<br>C; Ruffets Close, yet to be laid-out, near the hedgeline; 
<br>D; The estate had 3 simple churches; Anglican St Johns on far right (now its church hall, bombed WW2); Catholic St Columbia, center, in Queenhill Rd (now its church hall) & Selsdon Baptist on far left (now its rear hall); (Presbyterian St Pauls built 1901, just N of the estate)
<br>E; The first 2 blocks of Selsdon shops; 'The Broadwalk' had been built by the cross road
<br>F; Was my father wrong in remembering Farleigh Road losing its trees and hedges to road widening, as seems there were none here? But also perhaps no pavement yet? Byron Road next to it also seems bare, but now is matured tree avenue
<br>G; Littleheath woodland has yet to be felled for the more difficult house plots in Littleheath Road. 
<br>F; The lost hedgeline tracks from Littleheath Woods to Croham Hurst & Littleheath to Ballards Farm has yet to be built-over; 
<br>G; The Ruffets circular clump of woodland is seen. Part of it survived the later redevelopment by Chapel View shops
<br>H; Signs of the depressions in the Littleheath's fenced-off field 'Clears Croft' can still be seen in the grass of air photos. Perhaps ponds for cows? or chalk pits after the cows left? This field touched Littleheath Wood's other field, 'Fallen Oak Field', through a gate back then
<br>I; Perhaps just 5 cars visible in photo, parked or driving? (In 1950s, my father had to prove to council he'd rented a garage before buying a Norbury house, as on-road parking was prohibited. So a Croham Heights garage was quite a draw. I think cars kept outside garages was still frowned on, unless for traditional weekend car-washing). Also surprising for May, no smoke visable?
<br>J; Three courts at the tennis club, 2 more added later; by the 18 hole mini golf course's land (Selsdon Players performed at tennis club's pavilion from 1929*)
<br>K; Kathleen Starr (1922-2014) at 127 Farley Rd from Sept.1927 said 'Once Farley Rd & Croham Valley Rd were cut, S.Croydon commuters no longer walked over fields'. [<i>was that before she moved in? p.9 above mentions walk from Croham Rd up a Crohamhurst footpath (assume lost tio golf club?)</i>] A private bus then started, to door with no bus stops, sold tickets from booth in 94 Farley Rd's front garden*. For a year no houses to Littleheath Woods, just poppies in old potato field, Unemployed laid gravel paths across the field to Littleheath Woods from entrance to Brent Rd, & Foxearth Rd; *from <a href="https://www.eastsurreyfhs.org.uk/images/Journal/2014/Journal-SEP-14-READ.pdf">pdf</a> : [<i>too late for stock collapse Oct'29 starting 'Great Depression', so not resession jobs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_Kingdom">wiki</a></i>]
<br>L; Littleheath School at 66 Farley Rd*
<br>M; The cul-de-sac top left is Ballard's Rise; above that is Woodside Cottage on Ballards Farm Rd, half way along track between Ballards Farm & what's now the base of Croham Valley Rd
<br>O; Wonder why isolated inital development of 6 buildings in middle of Ballards Way' Perhaps showhouses?
<br>** [<i>p.9 above gives alternative bus; nr.54 E.Croydon, S.Croy, Swan & Sugerloaf, Croham Rd, Normanton Rd, Lismore Rd, & Selsdon Rd to the Estate; Brochure claims 7 minute bus ride; (route in map on top of page)</i>]

<figcaption><b>June 1931</b>; Part of higher resolution air photo from <a href="historicengland.org.uk">historicengland.org.uk</a> shows Croham Heights almost completely built;
<br>A; Area around St John's Church (Hall) not built-out until now, (Sylvans Close). [<i>had road access from start, so odd not built 1st, had a graveyard once been considered?</i>]
<br>B; Houses on one side of Croham Valley Road between Farliegh Rd & Ballards Way not yet built (& Ballards Way gardens not yet laid-out?)
<br>C; The missing 2 semis in Foxearth Road. So seem Costain's may not have completely given-up on driving their planned road of houses through Gee Wood (which was incorporated with Littleheath Wood behind it, & others. Hence the plural 'Littleheath Woods')
<br>D; The 4 sided, trapezoid, (hay?) field mid left, by the estate's mini-golf course, was planted as woodland (Trees might screen the estate & its uncool mini-golf course from the proper golf course). Plans in 1926 for 30 more tennis courts, so assume here.
<br>E; The land inside Croham Valley Rd, Crest Rd & Ballards Way do not yet have gardens, so are still being finished
<br>F; The other side of Crest Road have gardens. At the end of the gardens, Ballards Farm (H) keeps the hedged track from entrance to Littleheath Woods (I), at least until the next cow pasture got developed

<p><b>1932 Extension of Croham Heights</b>; building started 1932; From Selsdon Residents Association's, Selsdon Gazette; Dec 2023</b>, <a href="https://selsdon-residents.co.uk/resources/Gazette">see</a>; mail2.selsdonresidents@gmail.com; 
<br>Costains wanted to build 150 houses proposing 50 each of 3 styles & specification. The Council wanted more variety & eventually, in Dec.1931, planning granted for 108 houses of 4 house styles with 6 alternative specifications. The plan laid out Norfolk & Arundel Aves. Its convoluted arrangement constrained by 2 grand houses & topography. Arundel Ave accessed onto Upper Selsdon Rd & Norfolk Ave onto Church Way. Once again, the naming process lacked imagination: Costain's London offices at Arundel & Norfolk Sts. Langley Oaks Ave, not on drawing board at that stage. 

<p>Further 42 houses agreed later. New houses marketed as 'Croham Heights', making play on the elevation, leading to healthy living. Costains described their new venture thus:

<p>60 years of building good homes, taught us to build them where people want to spend a lifetime. The beautiful Surrey hills on which the homes of Croham Heights st& were a favourite beauty spot for Londoners wanting to go afoot & awheel for their weekend ‘breather’. It is still a beauty spot, & bounded as it is by woodl&s & open heath & golf courses, it will remain so for the unending delight of those whose homes nestle on the hills. Typical English homes, these, in a typically English setting: mellow brick & timber, red roofed & fronted with wide walled gardens. It is a fact that doctors have little to do at Croham Heights except to bring in to the world a healthy generation of children who will inherit good homes. It is also a fact that people have settled at Croham Heights & rid themselves of chest weaknesses & other complaints that are aggravated by low-lying, damp residential districts..... The Sanderstead Woods form a fine background to this estate & fine views of Croham Hurst & golf links are obtained."

<p>Building commenced in March 1932 with the further houses on what is now Langley Oaks Avenue receiving planning permission in March 1933. By the end of 1934 almost all the houses had been constructed. The 4 styles of house were: Elmwood, Ashwood, Oakwood & Teakwood with the cheapest Elmwood priced at £945. More of those later.....</figcaption>

<p><b>1935</b>; I read the very short dual carriageway at the start of Croham Valley Rd was built in 1935. Seems surprisingly early for an isolated, surprisingly pointless, construction? But Croham Valley Rd was planned as an arterial road and it's extra-wide grass verges could allow 4 lanes. So perhaps it was planned to open-up development near Addington and perhaps join the London Ring Road? Wonder if the siding for Croham Valley Rd's builder's train was one part of the dual carriageway?

This Jan 1927 <a href="1926_croham_heights_newspapers.docx">article</a> may solve query. Selsdon Park Greyhound Racing Club, aquired 27½ acres opposite SCC's land for a school, Addington Rd <i>(so at Kingsway Ave/Langley Rd?)</i>.
