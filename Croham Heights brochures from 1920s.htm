<big><big><b>Croham Heights, South Croydon, Surrey; Two housing estate brochures from 1920s</b></big></big><small>

<p>Scanned form loose pages of Eric &amp; Joyce Soper, who moved to a 
semi-detached at 97 Croham Valley Road, after their marriage in 1950s 
and lived there until they were about 97 (so perhaps brochure health 
claims, including "complete recovery from serious illness" true?).

</p><p>Regret some pages of pamplet 2 are missing. I don't see these 
pamphlets yet on www (in 2025)), so worth publishing here, despite being
 incomplete. If anyone can send the missing pages, <script language="javascript">

<figcaption>page 29; Initial estate plan; much modified during estate construction
<br> - Extra roads were added, to increase housing density; (A) Ruffets Close, (B) Ballards Rise &amp; (C) Brent Road. 
<br> - Littleheath Woods were not built over as planned (I) (but the 
stub of the access road into Foxearth Rd still exists as a footpath into
 the woods (H)
<br> - A path joined Littleheath Woods to Croham Hurst golf course but 
was built over, the short stub (E) parallel to Croham Valley Rd remains 
(Interesting that this current track though Littleheath Woods (M) 
predates everything around it)
<br> - The path into Littleheath Woods from Croham Valley Rd, used to 
extend to Ballards dairy farm but was lost after Crest Rd built (F); 
<br> - The lost 18 hole miniature golf course is now 'Queenhill Rd Playspace' (G) (p.15 shows it in use); Acquired by Croydon 1936 <a href="https://cnhss.co.uk/green-place/queenhill-road-playspace/">see</a>; the 3 court tennis club and clubhouse in front
<br> - Croham Valley Road temporarily planned to stop at Crest Rd (D); 
Croham Valley Rd was designed wider than Farley Rd (J) so seemed 
intended to be the main road before access across to Monk's Hill was 
blocked; <i>[think I was told, Farley Rd was widened later, losing its trees &amp; verges?]</i>; 
<br> - The original tracks to the dairy farm remained after Croham Valley Rd was built (K)
<br> - Seems the steep path by The Village Club was intended to be drive leading to 2 house plots? (P)
<br> - Selsdon Farm's plot is Aldi (L); 
<br> - Perhaps the estate's entry arch in the opening film above was junction of Queenhill &amp; Byron Roads? (N); </figcaption>

<br>A; Ballards Way (at top) has been built, 
<br>B; But Croham Valley Road after Farley Rd is a chalk area (a raized 
chalk bund as area can flood?) &amp; is yet to join to Crest Road chalk 
roundations; Cow herd still grazing there, as part of Ballards Way dairy
 farm.
<br>C; Ruffets Close, yet to be laid-out, near the hedgeline; 
<br>D; The estate had 3 simple churches; Anglican St Johns on far right 
(now its church hall, bombed WW2); Catholic St Columbia, center, in 
Queenhill Rd (now its church hall) &amp; Selsdon Baptist on far left 
(now its rear hall); (Presbyterian St Pauls built 1901, just N of the 
estate)
<br>E; The first 2 blocks of Selsdon shops; 'The Broadwalk' had been built by the cross road
<br>F; Was my father wrong in remembering Farleigh Road losing its trees
 and hedges to road widening, as seems there were none here? But also 
perhaps no pavement yet? Byron Road next to it also seems bare, but now 
is matured tree avenue
<br>G; Littleheath woodland has yet to be felled for the more difficult house plots in Littleheath Road. 
<br>F; The lost hedgeline tracks from Littleheath Woods to Croham Hurst 
&amp; Littleheath to Ballards Farm has yet to be built-over; 
<br>G; The Ruffets circular clump of woodland is seen. Part of it survived the later redevelopment by Chapel View shops
<br>H; Signs of the depressions in the Littleheath's fenced-off field 
'Clears Croft' can still be seen in the grass of air photos. Perhaps 
ponds for cows? or chalk pits after the cows left? This field touched 
Littleheath Wood's other field, 'Fallen Oak Field', through a gate back 
then
<br>I; Perhaps just 5 cars visible in photo, parked or driving? (In 
1950s, my father had to prove to council he'd rented a garage before 
buying a Norbury house, as on-road parking was prohibited. So a Croham 
Heights garage was quite a draw. I think cars kept outside garages was 
still frowned on, unless for traditional weekend car-washing). Also 
surprising for May, no smoke visable?
<br>J; Three courts at the tennis club, 2 more added later; by the 18 
hole mini golf course's land (Selsdon Players performed at tennis club's
 pavilion from 1929*)
<br>K; Kathleen Starr (1922-2014) at 127 Farley Rd from Sept.1927 said 
'Once Farley Rd &amp; Croham Valley Rd were cut, S.Croydon commuters no 
longer walked over fields'. [<i>was that before she moved in? p.9 above mentions walk from Croham Rd up a Crohamhurst footpath (assume lost tio golf club?)</i>]
 A private bus then started, to door with no bus stops, sold tickets 
from booth in 94 Farley Rd's front garden*. For a year no houses to 
Littleheath Woods, just poppies in old potato field, Unemployed laid 
gravel paths across the field to Littleheath Woods from entrance to 
Brent Rd, &amp; Foxearth Rd; *from <a href="https://www.eastsurreyfhs.org.uk/images/Journal/2014/Journal-SEP-14-READ.pdf">pdf</a> : [<i>too late for stock collapse Oct'29 starting 'Great Depression', so not resession jobs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_Kingdom">wiki</a></i>]
<br>L; Littleheath School at 66 Farley Rd*
<br>M; The cul-de-sac top left is Ballard's Rise; above that is Woodside
 Cottage on Ballards Farm Rd, half way along track between Ballards Farm
 &amp; what's now the base of Croham Valley Rd
<br>O; Wonder why isolated inital development of 6 buildings in middle of Ballards Way' Perhaps showhouses?
<br>** [<i>p.9 above gives alternative bus; nr.54 E.Croydon, S.Croy,

have completely given-up on driving their planned road of houses through
 Gee Wood (which was incorporated with Littleheath Wood behind it, &amp;
 others. Hence the plural 'Littleheath Woods')
<br>D; The 4 sided, trapezoid, (hay?) field mid left, by the estate's 
mini-golf course, was planted as woodland (The trees did screen the 
estate &amp; its mini-golf course from the proper golf course). 1926 
plans for 30 more tennis courts, so assume here.
<br>E; The land inside Croham Valley Ed, Crest Rd &amp; Ballards Way do not yet have gardens, so are still being finished
<br>F; The other side of Crest Road have gardens. At the end of the 
gardens, Ballards Farm keeps the hedged track from entrance to 
Littleheath Woods, at least until the next cow pasture got developed

</p><p><b>1932 Extension of Croham Heights</b>; building started 1932; From Selsdon Residents Association's, Selsdon Gazette; Dec 2023, <a href="https://selsdon-residents.co.uk/resources/Gazette">see</a>; mail2.selsdonresidents@gmail.com; 
<br>Costains wanted to build 150 houses proposing 50 each of 3 styles 
&amp; specification. The Council wanted more variety &amp; eventually, 
in Dec.1931, planning granted for 108 houses of 4 house styles with 6 
alternative specifications. The plan laid out Norfolk &amp; Arundel 
Aves. Its convoluted arrangement constrained by 2 grand houses &amp; 
topography. Arundel Ave accessed onto Upper Selsdon Rd &amp; Norfolk Ave
 onto Church Way. Once again, the naming process lacked imagination: 
Costain's London offices at Arundel &amp; Norfolk Sts. Langley Oaks Ave,
 not on drawing board at that stage. 

</p><p>Further 42 houses agreed later. New houses marketed as 'Croham 
Heights', making play on the elevation, leading to healthy living. 
Costains described their new venture thus:

</p><p>60 years of building good homes, taught us to build them where 
people want to spend a lifetime. The beautiful Surrey hills on which the
 homes of Croham Heights st&amp; were a favourite beauty spot for 
Londoners wanting to go afoot &amp; awheel for their weekend ‘breather’.
 It is still a beauty spot, &amp; bounded as it is by woodl&amp;s &amp; 
open heath &amp; golf courses, it will remain so for the unending 
delight of those whose homes nestle on the hills. Typical English homes,
 these, in a typically English setting: mellow brick &amp; timber, red 
roofed &amp; fronted with wide walled gardens. It is a fact that doctors
 have little to do at Croham Heights except to bring in to the world a 
healthy generation of children who will inherit good homes. It is also a
 fact that people have settled at Croham Heights &amp; rid themselves of
 chest weaknesses &amp; other complaints that are aggravated by 
low-lying, damp residential districts..... The Sanderstead Woods form a 
fine background to this estate &amp; fine views of Croham Hurst &amp; 
golf links are obtained."

</p><p>Building commenced in March 1932 with the further houses on what 
is now Langley Oaks Avenue receiving planning permission in March 1933. 
By the end of 1934 almost all the houses had been constructed. The 4 
styles of house were: Elmwood, Ashwood, Oakwood &amp; Teakwood with the 
cheapest Elmwood priced at £945. More of those later.....

<br>Was the circle in Croham Park at the bottom for? Part of golf 
practice? Too small for horses?; 1937 seems far too early for a 
helicopter circle? Though it seems to have an 'H' next to it?; Pure 
guess, but might possibly be a reporting point for French arrivals to 
Croydon Airport?</figcaption>
